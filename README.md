Welcome to our automated testing for the hotel app!
We are using Playwright and TypeScript. <br />
Please add a .env file with correct data as per the .env-examples file. Then run the tests via the shell script run-tests.sh in the terminal. <br />
Alternatively, YOU can start the hotel app on your own and run the tests via the script 'npm run testing' or 'npx playwright test'. <br />
If you use the second option, run 'npm run test-report' or 'npx playwright show-report' to open the test report.
